Deformable DETR: Understanding Deep Learning with Computer Vision

This project explores the concepts of deep learning and computer vision using the Deformable Detection Transformer (Deformable DETR). It is designed as an educational resource for understanding how transformers can be applied to object detection tasks in images.

Overview

Deformable DETR is an enhanced version of the Detection Transformer (DETR), which overcomes some of the original model's limitations, such as slow convergence and difficulty handling large feature maps. This project walks through the key components of the Deformable DETR architecture and demonstrates its application to object detection tasks.

Key Features

Transformer Architecture: Implements attention mechanisms tailored for object detection.

Deformable Attention: Efficiently focuses on relevant regions of an image.

Object Detection: Identifies and classifies multiple objects in an image.
